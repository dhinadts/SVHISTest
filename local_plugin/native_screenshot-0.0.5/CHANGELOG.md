### Android
- Unified the code to condesate the plugin initialization and use for the v1 and v2 Flutter's plugin engine.
- Now the screenshot is written to a folder with the application name on it, if fails then goes to external storage.
- Tried `Canvas` and `PixelCopy` approaches, both throws a black image, still uses `getBitmap()` method.

## 0.0.1
### iOS
- Basic functionionality done.

### Android
- Tries to request permission if possible and considers `PixelCopy` (_API >= 26_) that still not works; `getBitmap()` works, so this is used for now.
